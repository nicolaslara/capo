//! DT3: remote runner attach over the tunnel.
//!
//! This module is the DT1/DT3 SEAM the substrate update names: it wires the
//! server's runtime endpoint resolution through a [`ConnectivityTunnel`] and binds
//! the resulting reachability channel to a [`RemoteProcessRunner`], so the server
//! drives an agent process on a REMOTE runner device through the EXISTING
//! `RuntimeRunner` boundary — no loop change, no new transport protocol.
//!
//! It deliberately does NOT reimplement the RR8 remote runner: it COMPOSES the
//! in-tree boundaries. RR8's [`SshRemoteProcessRunner`] resolved its target via a
//! DIRECT `SshRemoteConfig` (host/key); DT3 resolves it instead via the tunnel so
//! reachability stays SEPARATE from execution (the connectivity boundary resolves +
//! opens the channel; the runner owns the process group). The transport itself is
//! injected by the caller so the deterministic suite binds a `FakeRemoteChannel`
//! (NO network) while the live DT7 smoke binds the real `SshRemoteChannel`.
//!
//! Safety boundary (DT3): the runner-side redaction-before-transit pass already
//! lives in [`RemoteProcessRunner::stream_output`] (it redacts each delta BEFORE it
//! becomes an event/artifact, on the leg Capo controls); this seam only resolves
//! reachability and never carries a raw credential — identity is the derived
//! channel fingerprint (a HANDLE), never a key/token.
